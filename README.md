## Usage

First you'll need to register your bot and get an API token.

Just talk to [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow a few simple steps. Once you've created a bot and received your authorization token, head down to the [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) manual to see what you can teach your bot to do.
